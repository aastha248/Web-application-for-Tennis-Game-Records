# Questions
**A) What SQL or NOSQL database did you choose and why?**<br>

I chose MongoDB as the database framework for this project. Reasons:<br>
1) It is open source<br>
2) It is schemaless<br>
3) It stores data in the JSON format<br>

**B) What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?**<br>

1) Since it was an extension of the previous project, making AJAX style API calls was really easy with NodeJS. <br>
2) uploading the project to github and running the application on heroku was a lot more easier this time. <br>

**C) What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?**

1) adding MLAB add-ons to Heroku was really a task. <br>
2) Handling the Non-blocking jquery structure with loops was an issue. <br>

**D) If you were to use these technologies professionally, what would be your biggest concern?**<br>

1) Making Ajax based calls for bigger data sizes will be a lot time consuming. <br>
2) Security and reliability is also a matter of concern since the data is on the cloud. <b>
